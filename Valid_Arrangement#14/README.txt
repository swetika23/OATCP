
Here are the algorithmic steps for the provided C++ code:

Input: Read the number of edges n.
Read Edges: Read n pairs of integers representing directed edges.
Graph Construction: Construct a directed graph G using an unordered map where each node u is mapped to a vector of its outgoing edges.
Degree Calculation: Calculate the indegree and outdegree of each node in the graph.
Find Start Node: Iterate over the nodes in the graph. If there exists a node u such that outdegree[u] - indegree[u] == 1, set start to u. Otherwise, set start to the first node in the input edge list.
Eulerian Path Calculation: Perform a modified depth-first search (DFS) called Eulerian path starting from the start node. In this DFS, process each edge only once and store the edges in the ans vector in post-order.
Output: Reverse the ans vector and print the edges of the Eulerian path.
