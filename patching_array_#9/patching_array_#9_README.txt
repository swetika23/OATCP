Initialize a variable cnt to count the number of patches needed, set to 0.
Initialize a variable i to iterate over the input array nums, set to 0.
Initialize a variable maxNum to track the maximum number that can be formed using the elements of nums, set to 0.
Repeat the following steps while maxNum is less than n:
a. If i is less than the size of nums and the element at index i in nums is less than or equal to maxNum + 1, increment maxNum by the value at index i in nums and increment i.
b. Otherwise, increment maxNum by maxNum + 1 and increment cnt to indicate a patch is added.
Return the value of cnt as the minimum number of patches required to make the sum of elements in nums reach at least n.
In the main function:

Read an integer n from the input, indicating the size of the array v.
Create an empty vector v.
Read n integers from the input and push them into the vector v.
Read an integer m from the input, indicating the target sum.
Call the minimumPatches function with arguments v and m, and store the result in ans.
Print the value of ans to the output.
