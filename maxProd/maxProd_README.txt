1) Define a function findMaxProduct that takes a vector of integers nums as input and returns an integer.
2) Initialize two variables: maxi to store the maximum product found so far (initialized to INT_MIN), and prod to store the current product (initialized to 1).
3)Iterate through the nums vector from left to right:
Update prod by multiplying it with the current element of nums and taking the modulus with MOD.
Update maxi with the maximum of prod and the current value of maxi.
If prod becomes 0, reset it to 1.
4) Reset prod to 1.
5) Iterate through the nums vector from right to left:
Update prod by multiplying it with the current element of nums and taking the modulus with MOD.
Update maxi with the maximum of prod and the current value of maxi.
If prod becomes 0, reset it to 1.
6) Return maxi.

In the main function:

Read an integer n from the standard input.
If n is greater than 0, proceed with the following steps, otherwise print 0 and exit.
Read n integers from the standard input and store them in a vector nums.
Call the findMaxProduct function with nums as the argument and store the result in a variable product.
Print the value of product to the standard output.
